# To find the time period of simple pendulum
Simple Pendulum is a small bob of mass m, also known as pendulum bob which is suspended from
a light wire or string. The period of pendulum is the time required for pendulum to complete one oscillation. One oscillation is the motion of the pendulum beginning at some reference point and continuing untill the reference point is reached again. The time period (T) is estimated using:

L is the length of the string and g is acceleration due to gravity
# Objectives
1 To use a classical mechanics function as a python function and using this function as an argument in another function.
# Steps to implement
- Define a classical mechanics function as periodic time with arguments l and g.
- Use Lambda function is used to calculate the periodic time.
- List the length values.
- Use map function to calculate time using each element in the lists.
- Create a list of periodic times using the map elements.
- Print results which takes the periodic time of index 0 in the length list and give its 
   corresponding value in the time lists.
- The process is repeated
  # Functions used
- Lambda Function : Lambda function is used as a substitute for fully fledge name function to use it as a simple operation. They have limitations in comparision to function defined by 'def'. They are mostly used for simple one linear operations and are not preferred for multisteps complex operations
- Map function: Map function is used to apply a specificed function to each item in an iterable and return a new iterable containing the results.

# Code Using Module
Module is a file containing python definition and statements and can be imported into other modules. Using module we can import the file created earlier to use it in several programs. The filename is the module name with .py appended and is imported with the module name to run the program we want.
 ```python
import math

def calculate_periodic_time(l):
  """Calculates the periodic time of a simple pendulum.

  Args:
    l: The length of the pendulum in meters.

  Returns:
    The periodic time of the pendulum in seconds.
  """
# Acceleration due to gravity in meters per second squared.
  g = 9.81
# use lambda function calculate the periodic time where l is the length of the string and return the value calculated
  calculate_periodic_time= (lambda l: 2* math.pi/ math.sqrt(g / l))
  return calculate_periodic_time
  
__all__=["calculate_periodic_time"]
```
```python
import algorithm
lengths_list = input("Enter a list of length, separated by commas: ")
  # Split the user input string into a list.
lengths_list = lengths_list.split(",")
  # Convert the elements of the list to integers
integer_list = []
for element in lengths_list:
  integer_list.append(int(element))
    # Print the integer list.
print("your list of lengths is: ", integer_list)
    #--------------------------------------------------------------#
    # Use map to apply the lambda function to each length in the list
periodic_times = map(calculate_periodic_time(integer_list), integer_list)
    # Print the periodic times and round them to 2 sig digits
T=[periodic_time for periodic_time in periodic_times]
round_time=[round(element,2) for element in T]
print("periodic times corresporing to the lengths are ", round_time)

# Implementing Pylint
Pylint is a powerful tool that help to maintain quality and consistency of python codes. It helps to write cleaner, more readable, and less error-prone code by identifying and flagging potential issues and errors adherence to coding standards.
